# NixOS notes:

I got this to work in the devshell with `cargo run --bin callme-cli`.

While callme-egui also builds and runs, it crashes when trying to paste in a node ID, so YMMV.

# callme

Audio calls with Iroh!

`callme` is an experimental library and tool that uses [iroh-roq](https://github.com/dignifiedquire/iroh-roq) to transfer Opus-encoded audio between devices. It uses [cpal](https://github.com/RustAudio/cpal) for cross-platform access to the device's audio interfaces. It includes optional audio processing with echo cancellation, and should run on most platforms.

## Crates

See the READMEs of the individual crates for usage instructions.

* **[callme](callme)** is the main Rust library used by all other crates in the workspace.
* **[callme-cli](callme-cli)** is a basic command-line tool to make audio calls.
* **[callme-egui](callme-egui)** is a GUI for callme. It runs on desktop (Linux, macOS, WindowS) and Android. iOS support is currently untested, but should work. See the [README](callme-egui/README.md) for detailed instructions.
